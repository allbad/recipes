Ingredients:
 - 3 to 4 pound boneless pork butt/shoulder roast
 - 1 teaspoon ground coriander
 - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
 - 1 teaspoon salt
 - 1 teaspoon black pepper
 - 2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
 - 4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
 - 1 onion, peeled and cut into 8 chunks
 - 1/2 can of coconut milk
 - Lime wedges for garnish

Directions:
  1. Mix together the coriander, cumin, salt and pepper. Use your fingers to rub the seasonings all over the roast.
  2. Place the meat in a slow cooker and surround with onions, garlic, ginger and the half can of coconut milk.
  3. The roast will give off moisture and fat while cooking, doubling or tripling the amount of broth by the time the roast is ready.

Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for 5 to 6 hours or on low for 8 to 10 hours. Although both cooking temperatures give delicious results, meat cooked on low will be the most tender.
